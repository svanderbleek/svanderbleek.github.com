<p>
There are some cool DSL micro-frameworks in Ruby but sometimes you want to make something really quick on your own, and make it clear, I try to avoid unnecessary meta programming to improve readability. Here's a method I came up with to use a simple temporary vanilla Object as context for a Module only DSL with variables.

<p>
First define the DSL attributes that will be set and methods that will use those attributes
</p>

<p class="code-paragraph">
<pre>
module MyDSL
  def self.define(&block)
      context = Object.new
      context.send(:extend, self)
      context.instance_eval(&block)
    end

    def some_attribute(value=nil)
      name ? @some_attribute = value : @some_attribute
    end

    def some_method
      ...
    end

    private

    ...
end
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Then use it! Fairly painless, no?
</p>

<p class="code-paragraph">
<pre>
MyDSL.define do
  some_attribute 'value'
  some_method
end
</pre>
</p>
