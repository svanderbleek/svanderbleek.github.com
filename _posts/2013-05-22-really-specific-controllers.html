title: Really Specific Controllers

<p>
As a web developer beautiful resource routes are important, especially when using Rails which makes it very easy to think resourcefully. An early principle I learned was not to nest resources deeper than two levels. I've refined this position in my own use to follow a pattern of deffering sub-resource management to a specific sub-resource controller but allowing creation namespaced by the creating resource, which acts like a context for filling in the sub-resources parameters.

So Use
</p>

<p class="code-paragraph">
resource/sub-resource/new
</p>

<p>
for a creation form then post to
</p>

<p class="code-paragraph">
sub-resource
</p>

<p>
for actual database creation and continue with
</p>

<p class="code-paragraph">
sub-resource/:id
</p>

<p>
for manipulation.
